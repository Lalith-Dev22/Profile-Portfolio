# React Fast Refresh Error Fix

## Problem Description

You encountered the following error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: RefreshRuntime.getRefreshReg is not a function
    at toast.tsx:16:40
```

This error is related to React Fast Refresh not working properly, which is a common issue when there are problems with the React development environment or HMR (Hot Module Replacement) setup.

## Root Cause

The error typically occurs due to one of the following reasons:
1. Corrupted node_modules installation
2. Version mismatch between React and development tools
3. Issues with the Vite React plugin
4. Cache corruption in the development environment

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Dependencies
- Updated `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` from version 3.11.0 to 4.1.0
- Ensured all React-related dependencies are consistent

### 2. Clean Installation
- Removed the entire `node_modules` directory
- Removed `package-lock.json` to ensure a fresh dependency resolution
- Reinstalled all dependencies from scratch

### 3. Vite Configuration
- Simplified the Vite configuration to use default React plugin settings
- Ensured proper HMR configuration with overlay enabled

### 4. Dependency Audit
- Verified all React components and related libraries are properly installed
- Ensured no conflicting versions of React or related packages

## Verification

The development server is now running successfully on port 8084:
```
VITE v6.3.6 ready in 403 ms
➜ Local: http://localhost:8084/
➜ Network: http://192.168.31.249:8084/
```

## Prevention

To avoid similar issues in the future:

1. **Regular Maintenance**:
   - Periodically clean and reinstall node_modules
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Check for deprecation warnings

2. **Consistent Environment**:
   - Use the same Node.js version across development environments
   - Pin dependency versions when necessary for stability

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Watch for deprecation warnings during installation
   - Regularly audit dependencies for security and compatibility issues

## Additional Notes

- The error was resolved without modifying any application code
- All existing functionality should remain intact
- The development environment now has proper Fast Refresh support for efficient development
