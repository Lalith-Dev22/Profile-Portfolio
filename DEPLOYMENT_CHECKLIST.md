# Deployment Checklist

## Configuration Fixes Applied

- [x] Updated vercel.json to specify "framework": "vite"
- [x] Added outDir: "dist" to vite.config.ts build settings
- [x] Updated build script in package.json to include TypeScript compilation
- [x] Changed vercel-build script to use npm run build
- [x] Removed "rollup" from optimizeDeps.exclude in vite.config.ts
- [x] Added proper type definitions to resolutions and overrides
- [x] Removed legacy-peer-deps from .npmrc to expose real dependency issues
- [x] Updated Vite to compatible version for Node.js 20.18.0
- [x] Removed unused "code" package to fix hoek vulnerability
- [x] Fixed all security vulnerabilities with npm audit fix --force

## Additional Steps to Ensure Successful Deployment

### 1. Environment Variables
- [x] Reviewed .env and .env.production files
- [ ] Ensure environment variables are properly set in Vercel dashboard

### 2. Dependency Issues
- [x] Verified dependencies are compatible with Node 20.x
- [x] Fixed conflicting dependency resolutions
- [x] Resolved all security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Check for any remaining deprecated dependencies

### 3. Build Verification
- [x] Successfully ran `npm run build` locally
- [x] Verified dist folder contains correct output

### 4. Vercel Settings
- [ ] Verify Vercel project settings match our configuration
- [ ] Check that the correct Node.js version (20.x) is selected in Vercel

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Module Resolution Errors
If you encounter MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors:
1. Check that all dependencies are properly listed in package.json
2. Verify that resolutions and overrides in package.json are correct
3. Clear Vercel's build cache if needed

### Memory Issues
If builds fail due to memory constraints:
1. Consider code splitting in vite.config.ts
2. Optimize large dependencies
3. Use Vercel's enterprise plan for more memory if needed

## Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Test all routes and navigation
- [ ] Verify all assets load correctly
- [ ] Check console for any runtime errors
- [ ] Test responsive design on different devices

## Build Results
✅ Local build completed successfully in 9.24s
✅ Dist folder generated with all required assets
✅ All npm audit vulnerabilities resolved
⚠️ Note: Some chunks are larger than 500 kB - consider code splitting for optimization
⚠️ Warning: Gradient syntax uses outdated direction syntax (not critical for deployment)
