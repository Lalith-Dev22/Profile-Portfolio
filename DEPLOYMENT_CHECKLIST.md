# Vercel Deployment Checklist

## Configuration Files Status

✅ **vercel.json** - Properly configured with build and output settings
✅ **package.json** - Contains proper scripts, engines, resolutions, and overrides
✅ **vite.config.ts** - Configured with proper build settings and optimizations
✅ **.env and .env.production** - Contains necessary environment variables
✅ **.npmrc** - Configured to handle dependencies properly
✅ **.gitignore** - Properly excludes unnecessary files

## Build Process

✅ **Local Build Test** - Successfully builds without errors
⚠️ **CSS Warnings** - Some gradient syntax warnings (normal for Tailwind CSS)
✅ **Output Directory** - Builds to `dist` folder as expected

## Vercel Deployment Settings

When deploying to Vercel, ensure these settings:

1. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
2. **Output Directory**: `dist`
3. **Install Command**: `npm install`
4. **Node.js Version**: Set to `20.x` in project settings

## Common Issues and Solutions

### MODULE_NOT_FOUND Errors
- ✅ Resolved by adding `resolutions` and `overrides` in package.json
- ✅ Fixed by adding `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true`
- ✅ Addressed by specifying Node.js engine version

### Native Module Issues
- ✅ Resolved by excluding rollup from optimizeDeps in vite.config.ts
- ✅ Fixed by adding proper rollup overrides

### Environment Variables
- ✅ Added SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK and DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN
- ✅ Separated development and production environment files
